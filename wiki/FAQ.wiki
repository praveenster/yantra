  # why is the project called _yantra_? what does it mean?
    yantra is the sanskrit word for "instrument" or "machine". refer to [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yantra wikipedia] for more.
  # what is _sanskrit_?
    seriously?
  # how is this project different from other modeling tools and code generators?
    it has one major difference - the code/solution is *entirely* generated by the tool, including the project files. it allows the user to focus on what to do rather than how to do.
  # what is a template? is it similar to a pattern?
    the idea is to create template for every aspect of the software ranging from building blocks such as loops to entire blocks of functionality. it goes beyond just describing the pattern/approach and instantiates the template for the task at hand.
